# gyarteRE(imagined)
This project is me adding all my new knowledge from 1 year of studying game programming in C# & C++ to my old Gymnasie-arbete where I made a simple game with another classmate. My goal with this project is to greatly improve on the code base, make the game more functional & playable and to show myself how far I have gotten in this 1 year of study.
